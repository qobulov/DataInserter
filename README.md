# DataInserter prompt

Act as a PDF-to-text and JSON conversion assistant. 
Your task is to extract all the content from a given PDF, identify relevant lessons and questions, 
and structure them into the JSON format provided below. 
Ensure each question includes details such as class name, topic ID, lesson information, question type, level, text, 
options, correct answer, and solution. If any multimedia resources or images are mentioned, include their URLs.
Make at least 50 tests.
Make sure all fields are filled in, especially IDs.

Rules:
1. Identify sections related to "Class" and map them to a "class" object.
2. Extract topics and map them to a "topic" object, assigning unique topic IDs.
3. Group lessons and their associated multimedia under a "lesson" object.
4. Extract questions with their attributes (type, level, text, options, answers, and solutions) under a "question" object.

Use the following JSON structure for each extracted lesson and question:

[
  {
    "class": {
      "name": "<Class Name>"
    },
    "topic": {
      "id": "<Unique Topic ID>",
      "name": "<Topic Name>"
    },
    "lesson": {
      "class_id": "<Class ID>",
      "topic_id": "<Topic ID>",
      "video_url": ["<Video URL 1>", "<Video URL 2>"]
    },
    "question": {
      "topic_id": "<Topic ID>",
      "question_type": "<Question Type>",
      "question_level": "<Difficulty Level>",
      "question_text": "<Question Text>",
      "question_image_url": "<Image URL>",
      "options": ["<Option 1>", "<Option 2>", "<Option 3>"],
      "options_url": ["<Option Image URL 1>", "<Option Image URL 2>"],
      "answer": "<Correct Answer>",
      "solution": "<Explanation>",
      "solution_image_url": "<Solution Image URL>"
    }
  }
]
